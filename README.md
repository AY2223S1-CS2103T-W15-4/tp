# FRIDAY
FRIDAY is a one easy-to-access desktop app for you to track your student's progress, optimized for use via a 
Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast,
FRIDAY can get your student's progress management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps !

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the [FRIDAY Website](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp).
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
