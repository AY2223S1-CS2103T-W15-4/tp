FRIDAY is a **desktop app for CS1101S Teaching Assistants to organize and track their students’ progress, optimized for
use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can
type fast, FRIDAY can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Commands

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>

  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>

  e.g `n/NAME [t/TELEGRAM_HANDLE]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/johndoe` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>

  e.g. `[tag/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `tag/fast learner`, `tag/fast learner tag/good at recursion` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>

  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME t/TELEGRAM_HANDLE`, `t/TELEGRAM_HANDLE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken. Note that this does not apply to the `INDEX` parameter in commands that have it, namely the `delete`, `edit`, `remark`, `grade`, `mark` and `unmark` commands, as they expect exactly one `INDEX` parameter.<br>

  e.g. if you specify `t/johndoe t/johndoe123`, only `t/johndoe123` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>

  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
