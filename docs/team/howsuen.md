### Project: FRIDAY

FRIDAY is a desktop application built upon AddressBook Level 3, used for managing CS1101S students.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about
10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added functionality to edit the grades of students.
  * What it does: Allows users to edit the grades of the listed assessments and examinations for each student.
  * Justification: This feature is significant in allowing users to keep track of their students' grades to get a better picture of how well their students are doing academically. It also allows users to check for improvement in their students' grades, thus checking whether their teaching methods are effective or not, and whether the students are able to keep up with the content.
  * Highlights: The current list of assessments and examinations are preset. The examinations include Reading Assessment 1 (RA1), Reading Assessment 2 (RA2), Practical Assessment (PA), Midterm Test, and Final Examination. Since the assessment format has remained the same over the years for CS1101S, we currently set these as the presets. Furthermore, users are to input scores in the form of percentages for a more comprehensive and generalised view of their students' grades. In the future, we are looking to allow users to edit these, i.e. changing the name, adding and removing assessments. In addition, we are also looking to allow users to input other forms of the scores such as "20/30" which represents a score of 20 out of a maximum of 30.

* **New Feature**: Added functionality to add remarks to students.
  * What it does: Allows users to add comments and notes on their students in addition to their related information.
  * Justification: This feature is significant in improving users' experience with the product because it acts as a centralised hub for users to easily write notes about their students to remind them of their individual circumstances.
  * Highlights: Initial implementation requires users to type prefix `r/` to indicate the start of the remark comment.
  * Credits: This feature was adapted from **[Tutorial 2 - Adding a new Command](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp/tutorials/AddRemark.html)** for **AB3**.
