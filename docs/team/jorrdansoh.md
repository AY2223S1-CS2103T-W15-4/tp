### Project: FRIDAY

FRIDAY is a desktop application built upon AddressBook Level 3, used for managing CS1101S students.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about
10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort students [\#109](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/pull/109)
  * What it does: Allows the user to sort students by different criteria (such as name or consultation date), in ascending or descending order.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product because a user can choose how they want to view the students, and see if they have any upcoming consultations or Mastery Checks.
  * Highlights: The current list of sorting criteria is: name, Telegram handle, consultation, Mastery Check, and grades.
